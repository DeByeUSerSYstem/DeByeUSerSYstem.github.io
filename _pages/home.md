Debussy is a package of programs implementing a fast approach to the Debye Scattering Equation (DSE) analysis for total scattering data from nanocrystalline and/or defective materials. <br>
See [J. Appl. Cryst. 2015, 48, 2026-2032] [1].

[Download] [2] the latest version and [get started] [3].

The Debussy package is made of **two main suites**: Claude and Debussy.

**Claude** (_Crystalline LAyered User DatabasE_ ) allows the user to efficiently build atomic clusters with different size and shape.

**Debussy** (_DEBye USer SYstem_ ) uses the previously created database(s) and carries out a fast calculation of the total scattering profile of each cluster that contributes to the total pattern, according to a suitable and adjustable size-distribution function. 

Features of the software includes:
- analysis on single- or multiple-phase specimens
- fitting on one or more experimental data set simultaneously (e.g. SAXS and WAXS datasets)
- fitting of data sets collected with synchrotron or laboratory instruments
- all scattering amplitudes/factors of atomic species already encoded into the program
- background components treated with experimental data or Chebyshev polynomials
- modelling of lattice expansions or contractions varying with the crystal size

For more details on _installation and usage_ please have a look at the [About] [4] page.
