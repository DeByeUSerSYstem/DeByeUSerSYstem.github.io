Debussy is a package of programs implementing a fast approach to the Debye Scattering Equation (DSE) analysis for powder diffraction data from nanocrystalline and/or non-ordered materials. See [J. Appl. Cryst. 2015, 48, 2026-2032](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576715020488).

[Download](https://debyeusersystem.github.io/download/) the laterst version and get started[get started](https://debyeusersystem.github.io/getting-started/).

The Debussy package is made of two main suites: Claude and Debussy.

Claude (Crystalline LAyered User DatabasE) allows the user to efficiently build atomic clusters with different size and shape.

Debussy (DEBye USer SYstem) uses the previously created database(s) and carries out a fast calculation of the diffraction profile of each cluster that contributes to the total pattern, according to a suitable and adjustable size-distribution function. 
Features of the software includes
- analysis on single- or multiple-phase specimens
- fitting on one or more experimental data set simultaneously
- fitting of data sets collected with synchrotron or laboratory X-ray
- all scattering amplitudes/factors of atomic species already encoded into the program
- background components treated with experimental data or Chebyshev polynomials
- modelling of lattice expansions or contractions varying with the crystal size
