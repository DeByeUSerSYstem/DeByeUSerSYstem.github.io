🌟 Exciting News Ahead! 🌟
🌈 Unveiling "[A Deep Learning Approach for Quantum Dots Sizing](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-127s9)" 📚💡🔍
🧠✨ Our pioneering fusion of Wide-Angle X-ray Total Scattering and AI surpasses 97% accuracy🎯, leaving calibration curves behind!🚀

Welcome to our exciting preprint, where we present a successful combination of total scattering data with a deep learning classifier for directly sizing quantum dots in both colloidal and dry states.
Our model💻, rigorously tested📊 on data📈 with physically meaningful augmentation, has tackled extreme conditions: from low QDs concentrations to short angular ranges and bad angular resolutions. The result? Solid performance🔥, even in untrained experimental conditions, leaving the chemists🧑‍🔬 and 🥼material scientists community with a robust and flexible model.
This offers a compelling alternative to the lengthy process🕰️ of deriving sizing curves from transmission electron microscopy coupled with spectroscopic measurements.

☀️ Nanoscale revelations await – Stay tuned for the future of quantum dots research!🔬📚
